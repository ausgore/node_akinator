# Akinator Unofficial Node API

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Akinator game](https://akinator.com), an awesome genie that's able to guess any character in your mind!

## Intro

This package was inspired by many akinator packages, including the python one, but the javascript versions were not good enough in my opinion or were not working.

**This project is not affiiliated with Akinator in any way! It is a community project**

If you like this project, please check out [Akinator](https://akinator.com)!

## Features

* üëå No dependencies (only `node-fetch`)
* ‚úÖ Written in TypeScript and strongly typed
* üß∏ Very easy to use
* ‚åö Asynchronous requests
* üîÅ Active development

## Installation

```bash
npm install node_akinator
```

## Usage

### Importing the package

Typescript:
```typescript
import { AkinatorClient, Languages, Themes, Answers } from 'node_akinator';
```

Javascript:
```javascript
const { AkinatorClient, Languages, Themes, Answers } = require("node_akinator");
```

### Example

Basic automated usage:
```typescript
// create the client
const akinator = new AkinatorClient(Languages.English, true, Themes.Character);

// go into async
(async() => {
    // start the game
    const start = await akinator.start();
    console.log(start.question);

    // let it run automatically until akinator won
    while (!akinator.won) {
        // answer yes all the time
        const answer = await akinator.answer(Answers.Yes);
        console.log(`(${answer.step}/100) ${answer.question}`);

        // wanna go back?
        // await akinator.back();
    }

    // win result and extra information
    console.log(akinator.winResult.name);

    // not satisfied? you can always continue. 
    // use (akinator.ko) to know if he lost.
    const answer = await akinator.continue();
    console.log(`(${answer.step}/100) ${answer.question}`);

    // OR maybe you're satisfied, 
    // then tell akinator.
    await akinator.submitWin();
})();
```
