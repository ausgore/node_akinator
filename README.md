# Akinator Unofficial Node API

> Node.js client for the unofficial [Akinator game](https://akinator.com), an awesome genie that's able to guess any character in your mind!

## Intro

This package was inspired by many akinator packages, including the python one, but the javascript versions were not good enough in my opinion or were not working.

**This project is not affiiliated with Akinator in any way! It is a community project**
